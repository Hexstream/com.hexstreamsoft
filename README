I finally decided to start managing my website's source code with Git,
so might as well publish it. And then, might as well dump it into the
public domain. Just for kicks. And because it's my usual modus
operandi. And because it might help someone somewhere at some point.

The presentation is currently quite crappy. I'm writing the HTML and
CSS by hand, which is to me unacceptable, but I have yet to clean up
my old (and awesome in some ways, but undocumented) Common Lisp
libraries for HTML and CSS (and form validation, and lots of other
cool stuff). Old story.
