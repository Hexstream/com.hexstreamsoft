  <p>It turns out that I'm unable to work effectively when trying to manage my 50+ pending projects and their relative states of completion and priorities entirely in my head. Please remember that this section is intended primarily to help me, so it's entirely possible that some things are explained badly or not at all. You're welcome to spy on it, and hopefully it can help you and/or entertain you in some way!</p>
