        <div id="page-description">Hello! I have 6 intensive years of Common Lisp experience.</div>
      </div>
      <p>Hello, I'm Jean-Philippe&nbsp;Paradis and for the last ~6 years I've been intensively in Common Lisp development. During that time, I developed many very useful, novel and non-trivial libraries (notably, a big bunch of libraries which constitute a kind of web framework). The process of opening up has been gradual, but now I develop ALL my projects entirely in the open and release them into the Public Domain with the <a href="http://unlicense.org/">Unlicense</a>. You can browse the code of all my projects <a href="https://github.com/Hexstream">on Github</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Hexstream/com.hexstreamsoft">including this website</a>, which is also entirely released into the Public Domain. So go ahead and steal and repurpose anything you want any way you like for any reason! I want my projects to reach their maximum possible impact and relevance!</p>

      <p>Even more interestingly, you can <a href="worknotes/">spy on me as I work</a>. With 50+ work-in-progress projects, I can't hold all the state of my projects and metaprojects in my head anymore, so I thought I might as well share it with the world.</p>

      <p>Historically, I've failed to put a dent in my mountain of old projects I've been trying to clean up and document so that anyone can use them easily, but thanks to my new "<a href="worknotes/">Worknotes Methodology</a>", I'm hopeful this is about to change drastically! I know this will be a <b>ton</b> of work but I am determined to do it, I'm sick of being the only user of my innovations.</p>

      <p>Right now I'm writing the HTML and CSS for this site by hand, which to me is unacceptable. Long ago I made some "really nice" HTML and CSS libraries and have some good experience with web development, but these web libraries currently are in a very sorry state so I'll use them again when their cleaning up is done.</p>
